        <p>All the activities including rooms, gym, the hotel sports field, and pool can be booked through this site to
            prevent clouding the hotel premises. Gym often takes place in the morning and the evening. Some guest is
            just
            interested in the gym which mean they live around and do not want to book a room but rather book for the
            only gym
            for their physical fitness arrangement is being made to take care of these people. The pool site can
            sometimes be
            for two. This means that for privacies sake people can book the poolside in other not to be disturbed by
            people.
            Also, to avoid a clash at the hotel sports field it is necessary to well arrange the place for those going
            to use
            the field to know their time range and the limit they can spend on the field. Lastly, rooms are the most
            important
            of all, the booking site allows the guest to know if there is a room available before they make a step
            toward the
            hotel. The management has sat in accordance not to fail any guest that is why it is necessary to check the
            site if
            there is room available.</p>
