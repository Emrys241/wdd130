                <p>Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname “Mad River.”

                    The first rubber raft was made by Lt. John Fremont and Horace H. Day believed to be built it the 1840s. They planned to survey the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Although invented back then, it was not until the turn of the century that the first commercial rafting trip took place. On June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon. In later years, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. constructed a modern resort hotel in Grand Teton National Park. In the late 1950s the lodge began offering float trips. They used surplus war rafts that were 8 ft wide by 27 ft long. Less than 500 people went that year but the demand started increasing. It was not until the 1960s and 70s that whitewater rafting companies started forming. In the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, whitewater rafting was included for the first time. Now whitewater rafting has risen to a popular sport and hobby, growing more and more every year. </p>

                <p>White water rafting remains a favored activity today.  As popularity has increased, the technology evolved and we have noticed a drastic change in the quality of gear.  The pioneers were using primitive rafts with limited flotation that would get heavier as they fill up with water.  These rafts are known today as “bucket boats” because of the necessity to bring buckets along to empty the rafts.  Innovative thinking lead to self-bailing rafts, with intentional holes to release water as they fill. We also noticed the addition of helmets for safety that were rarely used in the early rafting days.  This improvement in technology has made rafting a much safer sport, which has attracted a new crowd of thrill seekers. </p>
